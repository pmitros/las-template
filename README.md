Learning at Scale OLX Template
==============================

This is a simple template for a basic edX course in OLX. It's designed
for the authors at the L@S blended track who would like to use
automated means to generate their course, or who prefer working in
text editors.

To generate the course, run `make.sh` and upload the tarball in
Studio.

The key downside of the workflow is Studio has rather poor error
messages, and is quite sensitive. A bad course won't import, and won't
really tell you why.
